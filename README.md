# ðŸŒŠ Flood Area Segmentation (U-Net)  

This project uses **U-Net**, a deep learning architecture, to segment flooded areas from satellite images. It helps in **disaster management** by identifying regions affected by floods.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Uses **U-Net** for accurate flood segmentation  
- Works with satellite imagery to detect flooded regions  
- Can be extended for real-time flood monitoring  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled satellite images with flood annotations. It can be obtained from:  
ðŸ”— [Kaggle: Flood Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizalkarim/flood-area-segmentation)
